                <p>Shannon Nolan, Licensed Esthetician since 1995. Specializing in Botanical Skincare, 
                  Rose Quartz Facials, &amp; teen acne. She is also a Certified Aromatherapist &amp; Certified Master 
                  Herbalist all of which is incorporated into her Holistic Skincare Practice. Shannon opened Get 
                  Salty Skincare Studio to not only create a relaxing one of a kind space for her clients, but to 
                  be able to provide an affordable alternative &amp; complimentary therapy within her studio for guests 
                  with a variety of breathing &amp; skin conditions. The idea of the Salt Room stemmed from wanting 
                  to help her Father who has COPD &amp; her son who has terrible allergies. She wanted to have a place 
                  to share the benefits that the salt room provides for them with her family of clients as well.
